==WARNING==

This document is a *draft*, circulated only to attract comment and
correction.  It contains numerous errors of fact, vague
overgeneralizations, and misleading implications.  Many claims about
general topological spaces in fact apply only to Hausdorff spaces.
Much of the Applications section should be considered placeholders
that bear only a vague resemblance to the correct, accurate
explanations.  Readers not already familiar with topology may come
away with severe misapprehensions.  Do not rely on it for anything.

==WHAT==

Topology is the branch of mathematics that tries to understand
continuity and continuous functions.  You probably don't need to know
much topology for your CS degree, but people will bring it up from
time to time.  For example, you will hear in your category theory
class that topological spaces form a category with continuous
functions as the arrows.  Or you will hear that certain topological
spaces are natural models for intuitionistic logic.  The goal of these
notes is to be the minimal explanation of topology that will enable
you to understand those two things.
