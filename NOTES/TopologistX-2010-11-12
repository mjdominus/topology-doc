Hello Mark Dominus,

I noticed your post on topology on Planet Haskell, and, since I am a
(algebraic) topologist, I couldn't help reading and commenting your
introduction to topology.

Regards!


Connected sets :
****************

1. It seems curious (and wrong) to define the connectedness of a set,
when you are talking about a topological space.  I assume that you
want to simplify your introduction, but it hurts my eyes badly (yes, I
am a very sensitive mathematician) Is it because you want to avoid
mentioning subspaces?  In my opinion, it makes it more difficult for a
student to not give proper and complete definitions. The same remark
applies for the rest of the document.  Talking about the closure of a
set, or the boundary of a set does not make sense...

2. You define a separation of a set as a partition of S into two
disjoint parts X and Y, but you do not require that they should be non
empty.  According to your definition, every "set" A is disconnected :
take X = A and Y = emptyset.  Then Y is open, and X is included into
the full ambient space, which is open.

3. Exercise 1 seems wrong.  The empty set is connected.  Also, any
singleton {a} in R is connected.

Limits
******

4. (opinion) Exercise 11 doesn't seem very interesting to me. It is
immediate from exercise 10.

5. Your definition of a "dense" subset seems very imprecise~: what
does "many" means?  Besides, it seems wrong when you have some
discrete spaces.  For exemple, the integers Z are dense in the
integers Z, but your definition excludes those cases.

Continuity
**********

6. What does exercise 28 means?  You didn't define what an open
function is.  I guess that you meant "The image of an open set by a
continuous function is not necessarily open", or something along that
line.

7. Continuity on R^n?  I guess that you should rewrite that as
"continuity of functions from R^n to R^p".

Homeomorphic spaces
*******************

8. End of the first paragraph : shouldn't it be "is an homeomorphism"
instead of "is a homeomorphism"?


Applications
The category of topological spaces
**********************************

9. The fundamental group of a space is not really a property.  I would
describe it as an invariant, or a topological invariant.

10.  The loops are not considered equivalent if they can be smoothly
transformed into each other.  We don't require a smooth structure.
The correct notion is homotopy, or "continuously transformed into each
other" (emphasis on continuously!).

11. You say that the choice of the base point doesn't matter for
connected sets.  That is incorrect, it doesn't matter for path
connected sets.  You can have somme connected sets which are not path
connected, and in this case, the choice very much matter.

12.  The usual definition of a simply connected space require also
that it has only 1 path component (\pi_0(X) = \pi_1(X) = 0)

13.  Technically, the fundamental group functor goes from Top_\ast
(the POINTED topological spaces) to Grp, not from Top to Grp.
